## **The Basic Building Blocks of SSI**
There are seven basic building blocks of SSI.

### **Verifiable Credentials**
A verifiable credential (**VC**) is a way to express credentials digitally in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-preserving, and machine-verifiable. It contains *claims* about a *subject*, is issued by an *issuer*, held by a *holder* (who may or may not be the same as the subject). It can be verified by a *verifier* to answer four important questions -
1. Does it contain appropriate data in appropriate format?
2. When and by whom was it issued and was it tampered with?
3. Is it still valid - i.e. not expired or revoked?
4. Does it provide cryptographic proof that the holder is the subject?
