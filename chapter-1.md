# **Chapter 1**

**The Problem**  
The internet was built without a layer to cater to the identification of individuals and organizations connecting through the internet. It was, instead, oriented toward identifying devices that connected through the internet.

**The Reasons**  
Reasons include the fact that the original internet was not meant to be used globally, rather for research and exchange of information among a specific group of individuals. The TCP/IP protocol to build a network of networks was very effective in creating an internet based on the exchange of data between machines. But it was underequipped to uniquely connect individuals, organizations and other non-machine entities.


**What role can blockchain play?**  
The biggest change in introducing Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is the fact that it is truly decentralized. This is where blockchain comes in.

## **The three models of digital identity**  
Read [this](https://medium.com/evernym/the-three-models-of-digital-identity-relationships-ca0727cb5186) medium article for an elaborate discussion on these three types.

### **The Centralized Identity Model**
Under this model, a user has an identity with every single website, service, or application they receive a service from. For example, accounts in Facebook, Google, GitHub, Netflix etc. Each service provider grants an identity to a user in the form of an ***account***. The service provider is lending you credentials that represent you with limited controls and permissions. If you delete or take down all credentials you own with respect to all service providers, your virtual presence ceases to exist. But your siloed data is retained by these organizations or service providers.

Problems include:
- Burden of managing too many credentials
- Varying security policies across service providers (like minimum length, case or symbol requirements for passwords)
- Lack of portability and reusability of data
- Single point of failure for siloed storage of personal data

### **The Federated Identity Model**
The main idea behind this model is to have third party *identity providers* (**IDP**), to whom you and the website, service or application you are engaging with can federate the responsibilities of identification.  
The collection of all service providers who use the same IDP or group of IDPs is called a *federation*.  
Each organization or service provider within the federation, relying on this IDP or these IDPs, is known as a *relying party* (**RP**).

Problems include:
- Not ubiquitious - can't use one IDP across all services
- IDPs must have security and privacy policies that serve ALL relying parties
- IDPs become even bigger points of failure as centralized storage of private data for many services
- Lack of portability
- Can't accomodate the sharing of valuable personal data like passports, govt credentials, health data etc.


### **The Decentralized Identity Model**
This model is not account dependent. Rather it is the virtualization of the real world practice of keeping credentials and identifications in a wallet. Peer to peer connection, secured with public/private key cryptography makes this model equitable where the user and the organization are equal participants in the relationship or connection between them. Neither 'provides', 'controls' or 'owns' the relationship.  
Blockchain is used for a Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (**DPKI**). Uses:
- Establishing secure connections between any two peers by exchanging public keys
- Storing some of these public keys on public blockchains to verify signatures on Verifiable Credentials (digital identity credentials)

## **What is Self Sovereign Identity?**
> A personâ€™s identity that is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.

Two popular myths about SSI:  
1. **Self-sovereign identity is self-asserted identity**:  
The idea that only you can make identity assertions about yourself. This is false because most of your credentials and identities are dependent on information from trusted sources. Which is why everyone can rely on it.
2. **Self-sovereign identity is just for people**:  
The idea that only people can use SSIs. This is false because SSIs apply equally to organizations and things.

## **Why is SSI so important?**
SSI is so important because it represents a **shift in control or power**.  
Through this identity model, the control over identities is shifted from "centers of the network" (organizations that silo identities), to the "edges of the network" (where all of us exist and interact as peers).  
Over the next few years, SSI will progress rapidly with different SSI architectures popping up based on needs, wants and priorities of different communities implementing SSI. The most important thing to observe is how various SSI architectures become interoperable.
