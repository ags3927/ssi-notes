# **Self-Sovereign Identity - Chapter 1**

**The Problem**  
The internet was built without a layer to cater to the identification of individuals and organizations connecting through the internet. It was, instead, oriented toward identifying devices that connected through the internet.

**The Reasons**  
Reasons include the fact that the original internet was not meant to be used globally, rather for research and exchange of information among a specific group of individuals.
