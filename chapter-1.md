# **Chapter 1**

**The Problem**  
The internet was built without a layer to cater to the identification of individuals and organizations connecting through the internet. It was, instead, oriented toward identifying devices that connected through the internet.

**The Reasons**  
Reasons include the fact that the original internet was not meant to be used globally, rather for research and exchange of information among a specific group of individuals. The TCP/IP protocol to build a network of networks was very effective in creating an internet based on the exchange of data between machines. But it was underequipped to uniquely connect individuals, organizations and other non-machine entities.


**What role can blockchain play?**  
The biggest change in introducing Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is the fact that it is truly decentralized. This is where blockchain comes in.

## **The three models of digital identity**  
Read [this](https://medium.com/evernym/the-three-models-of-digital-identity-relationships-ca0727cb5186) medium article for an elaborate discussion on these three types.

### **The Centralized Identity Model**
Under this model, a user has an identity with every single website, service, or application they receive a service from. For example, accounts in Facebook, Google, GitHub, Netflix etc. Each service provider grants an identity to a user in the form of an ***account***. The service provider is lending you credentials that represent you with limited controls and permissions. If you delete or take down all credentials you own with respect to all service providers, your virtual presence ceases to exist. But your siloed data is retained by these organizations or service providers.

Problems include:
- Burden of managing too many credentials
- Varying security policies across service providers (like minimum length, case or symbol requirements for passwords)
- Lack of portability and reusability of data
- Single point of failure for siloed storage of personal data
